### Architecture Improvements - Further Refinements
- Completed separation of concerns between screens:
  - Removed all create functionality from `ChoreDetailScreen`
  - Ensured `ChoreDetailScreen` only handles displaying chore details
  - Completely removed conditional `isCreatingNewChore` logic from detail screen
  - Aligned navigation to correctly use dedicated screens for each function
- This ensures proper Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) adherence:
  - `ChoreCreateEditScreen` - Creating new chores only
  - `ChoreEditScreen` - Editing existing chores only
  - `ChoreDetailScreen`/`ChoreViewScreen` - Viewing chore details only
- Benefits:
  - Simpler, more focused screen implementations
  - Eliminated conditional branching complexity
  - Removed potential bugs from overlapping functionality
  - Improved code maintainability and readability

### Architecture Improvements
- Simplified `ChoreCreateEditScreen` to focus solely on creating new chores:
  - Removed all edit functionality to reduce complexity
  - Simplified state management by removing conditional logic
  - Improved screen title and logging to reflect its single purpose
  - Maintained parameter signature for API compatibility
- Created dedicated `ChoreEditScreen` for editing existing chores:
  - Implemented with focused edit-specific functionality
  - Provides clear separation between create and edit operations
  - Improves maintainability and reduces conditional complexity
- Updated navigation routes in `ChoresScreen.kt` to use the new dedicated screens
- Benefits:
  - Single responsibility principle better enforced
  - Reduced conditional logic complexity
  - Clearer codebase organization
  - Simplified debugging and maintenance

## 2025-05-10

### Code Refactoring
- Removed unused `AddChoreScreen.kt` file to eliminate redundancy
- Extracted the `TimePickerDialog` composable from `AddChoreScreen` to a reusable utility in `DialogUtils.kt`
- Extracted utility function `getValidHouseholdId()` to new `ChoreUtils.kt` file
- Fixed compilation errors in `ChoreDetailScreen.kt`:
  - Removed duplicated code blocks that were causing syntax errors
  - Updated imports to include necessary components
  - Fixed references to `getDayName` function from `DaysOfWeekDialog.kt`
- Extracted reusable Chore components from `ChoreDetailScreen.kt` to `ChoreComponents.kt` to improve code organization
  - Components extracted:
    - `ChoreDetailView`: Displays the details of a chore in read-only mode
    - `DetailRow`: Helper component for displaying label-value pairs  
    - `ChoreEditForm`: Form for creating or editing chores
  - This refactoring eliminates duplicate code and resolves compilation errors

### Architecture Improvements
- Split the dual-purpose `ChoreDetailScreen` into two separate screens with clear responsibilities:
  - `ChoreViewScreen`: Dedicated screen for viewing chore details in read-only mode
  - `ChoreCreateEditScreen`: Dedicated screen for creating new chores (edit functionality moved to a separate screen)
  - `ChoreEditScreen`: New dedicated screen for editing existing chores
- Updated navigation in `ChoresScreen.kt` to use the new screen components
- Benefits:
  - Improved single-responsibility principle adherence
  - Simplified code with clear screen purposes
  - Easier maintenance and future enhancements
  - Better separation of concerns
  - More intuitive user experience with dedicated screens
